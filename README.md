# Deep Learning for Side-Channel Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to the field of side-channel analysis in cryptography. We aim to develop models capable of detecting and classifying side-channel attacks using public datasets.

## Objectives
- Implement CNN models for side-channel attack detection
- Evaluate model performance on public side-channel datasets
- Contribute to the advancement of hardware security through machine learning

## Dataset
We utilize [ASCAD Dataset], a widely recognized dataset in the side-channel analysis community. This dataset contains [brief description of the data, e.g., power traces from AES implementations].

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Prepare and normalize the side-channel data
2. Model Architecture: Design and implement CNN models suitable for time-series data analysis
3. Training: Utilize PyTorch for model training and optimization
4. Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics relevant to side-channel analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.2.2
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- [Any other relevant libraries]

## Usage
